What is it?
Quiz app for learning to code
Multiple-choice format

For right now quizzes are entered on back end by admins (no admin interface yet)

Users create profile & log in
User can select quizzes from a library of quizzes
User can take a quiz right away or later
User can start a quiz and finish later
User's answer are saved in database, so user can view score & answers later

MVP allows simple quiz-taking and score-keeping only
But architecture allows for adding learning tools, such as links to more information, commenting
Early feature should be allowing users to see
  1) Which questions they got right or wrong
  2) Correct answers to all questions after finishing quiz

Entire app should be designed as mobile-first
